Still not in version 1.0. Still working on decompositions. There's also still a bunch of other bugs.

An Actionscript 3.0 Matrix library that uses caching to speed up execution.

For example, let's say you have a Matrix A, and you compute the determinant of A. The class will cache that value and whenever you recall determinant, this class will give you the cached value instead of recalculating the determinant.

The drawback to this is that, while it is fast, it takes up a bit more memory.
